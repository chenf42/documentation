We will have reducers and actions in Redux. The root reducer will contain the auth reducer, playlist reducer, and search reducer.

We'll be using the fetch API to get data from the server in the form of JSON. It will return a JSON Ojbect back and compare it to the whole redux state and change the state where there are differences.
