This section provides the reader with an overview of Synthify. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the product, as well as critical user interactions and user interfaces are described in detail.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
Synthify.me will get playlists from a user from each platform, and bring them all together and have the playlists unified under one service. The service will auto-update after a certain amount of time to make sure it's consistent with any playlist changes that the user may have done on the respective platform. The "look and feel" of Synthify.me is similar to Spotifiy's dashboard. Users should expect to listen to music from each platform they have signed up for.

\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
Synthify will utilize the various other streaming services' APIs to retrieve the user's playlists. Assuming these playlists are retrieved, the application will stream the music content using YouTube. The music will only be streaming when a user clicks the play button on a song or playlist. The external output will be music being played on the device the user is currently using.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
The look of Synthify is similar to Spotify's dashboard. Each song and playlist will have a play button that the user is able to click to start the song or playlist.
