### Introduction
- Executive Summary of the plan (purpose, scope, etc.)

### References 
- SRD (requirements drive the system-level test you do)
- ADS (architecture drives the subsystem and integration testing), etc. (detailed design, standards, sample plans, etc. that are test drivers)

### Test Item(s)
- Version of product (what you are testing at each stage)
- Design decomposition (relationship of specific modules to test plan, test cases)
- Limitations of product under test (restrictions, assumptions, caveats, etc.)
- Other product-level restraints on testing

### Risks
- Specific risks that may affect testing/test outcome
- Impact assessment and management plan as it relates to these risks

### Features to be tested
- List of specific features (from the USERS’ viewpoint) that you will test
- Assign a risk level (H, M, L) to each feature listed (ability to test to user’s satisfaction)

### Features NOT to be tested
- List of those features (USERS’ perspective) that cannot/will not be tested
- Describe rationale for not testing each item (not in current release, insufficient test capability, low risk feature that is hard to test, not a user-visible feature)

### Approach (Strategy)
- Overall test strategy (what, why, and how of your test plan)
- Number of hardware and software configurations tested/not tested
- Plan to deal with defects identified (re-integration, regression)
- Identify metrics for overall success (number of bugs found/corrected/open, number of critical features passed, etc.)
Identify any special requirements for testing

### Item Pass/Fail criteria
- List specific criteria for each feature to be tested (number and severity of defects, any specific tests that indicate system failure, etc.)
- Test Deliverables
- List what is to be delivered by this test plan (plan document, test cases, error logs, etc.)
- Test Schedule (should be consistent with your published project plan)
Approvals (anyone who needs to sign off on/agree with your plan)
