There are multiple types of music platforms available, but some platforms offer more than the other as far as content goes. Some people may be subscribed to more than one platform but desires that all of their content be in one place. Sure you could just have all of those platforms open individually and manually switch to them when you’re looking to find content on one that isn’t on the other, but it’s not the best UX. This project solves this issue and allows you to have all your content in one place.
