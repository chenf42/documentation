Some people use different services for managing and having access to music that isn't available on other platforms. Spotify playlists for one day, YouTube music playlists for another day. Maybe you even have a Soundcloud to listen to the next up \& coming artist. Itâ€™s tedious to manually open each platform to find music not available on the other. Wouldn't it be convenient if there was a way to grab all your playlists and music content and have them all available in one location? An aggregation of playlists, perhaps? Introducing synthify.me, a platform that will allow you to have all your music in one place.``
