Upon completion of the prototype system, we expect the following success indicators to be observed on kiosk stations implementing the new GUI software:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Successful connection to API’s (Primarily Spotify & YouTube, SoundCloud is a bonus)
  \item User authentication
  \item Grabbing music from the authenticated user
\end{itemize}

Within 3 months after the prototype delivery date, we expect the following success indicators to be observed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Successful connection to all API’s
  \item Displaying playlists in a clear UI that allows all to be seen one in convenient location
  \item Choosing a song plays the song
  \item Utilize AJAX to check and get updated playlists after a certain amount of time
\end{itemize}

Within 6 months after the prototype delivery date, we expect the following success indicators to be observed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each song has options that allow you to view the song depending on which service the original playlist (and song) is from..
    \item Spotify: https://rpl.cat/4CBg2t-gdI6QhixqLtxqOF5aF-loJwZ-RWYtIw5xElU
    \item YouTube: something like “View in YouTube” and link to song
  \item Dynamically create new playlists based off of mood, or audio features of a song
\end{itemize}
