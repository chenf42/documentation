\subsection{Settings}
The settings subsystem allows users to changed their user account information. A user can add more music accounts (SoundCloud, Spotify, etc), logout, and change the theme.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
One assumption made is that the user will be logged in before accessing the settings.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
This subsystem's primary responsibility is to allow a user to change their user information. The settings subsystem will be able to interact the with the Redux State interface to change the users theme, log them out, and add a music account to their Synthify account.
